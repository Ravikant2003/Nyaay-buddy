Preamble:

In the matter of Raju vs. State of Goa, the High Court of Goa is called upon to adjudicate a dispute regarding the ownership of a plot of land situated in the Panjim area, Goa. The case arises from a claim made by Raju, the plaintiff, asserting that he has been in possession of the land for more than twelve years and is the rightful owner of the property in question.

The State of Goa, through its legal representatives, contends that the land is government property, acquired for public purposes, and that the plaintiff's claim to the property is invalid. The dispute centers around the classification of the land, the historical ownership records, and the legal doctrines of adverse possession and government acquisition of land.

The Court is tasked with determining the true ownership of the property, reviewing the evidence presented by both parties, and providing a fair and just decision based on the principles of property law and established precedents.
