IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA  
Civil Appeal No. 2345 of 2021

The petitioner, Mr. Rajiv Mehta, filed a writ petition against the Union of India on 14th March 2021, challenging the constitutionality of Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, 2000. The case was heard in the Delhi High Court before Honâ€™ble Justice Ramesh Chandra.

The petitioner contended that his fundamental rights under Article 19(1)(a) were infringed due to arbitrary arrests made under Section 66A. In his arguments, he cited the precedent laid down in Shreya Singhal vs Union of India, (2015) 5 SCC 1.

The respondents, represented by Advocate General Ms. Neha Sharma, argued that the statute was necessary for maintaining public order and cyber discipline.

The court, after hearing the arguments on multiple dates including 22nd April 2021, 1st May 2021, and 15th May 2021, reserved its judgment.

On 30th May 2021, the Delhi High Court ruled that Section 66A was unconstitutional and struck it down. The judgment emphasized the importance of protecting free speech in a digital democracy.

The witness, Mr. Karan Thapar, a cyber law expert, also testified during the hearing, affirming the misuse of the provision by law enforcement agencies.

Further directions were issued to the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Cyber Crime Unit to review all cases filed under the repealed provision.

The case has now been escalated to the Supreme Court for a larger constitutional bench review.
