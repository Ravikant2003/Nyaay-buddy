Court Judgment:

Case Title: Raju vs. State of Goa
Court: High Court of Goa
Judge: Honorable Justice Meera Joshi

Judgment:
This court has examined the matter of the plaintiff, Raju, seeking redress for a disputed property ownership against the State of Goa. The dispute concerns the ownership of a plot of land situated in the Panjim area of Goa, which has been in possession of the plaintiff for several years. However, the State of Goa has alleged that the land in question is a government land and should therefore be in possession of the government.

Findings:
Land Title and Ownership: The plaintiff, Raju, claims ownership of the disputed land based on possession for over 12 years and holds an old revenue receipt for the payment of land taxes, showing continuous occupation of the land since the 1990s. This document supports the claim of long-term possession.

Government's Claim: The State of Goa, through its legal representatives, asserts that the land in question is part of a public utility area, originally acquired by the state under the Goa Land Acquisition Act, 1964, for construction of public infrastructure and is thus exempt from private ownership claims.

Survey Evidence: A court-appointed surveyor conducted an official survey of the disputed land. The survey report reveals that the land is not within the state’s designated public use zone, but instead falls under vacant non-agricultural land. No government infrastructure has been developed or is planned for this location.

Historical Evidence: The plaintiff has provided photographs, documents from local authorities, and testimonies of neighboring property owners to prove that the land has been used for agricultural purposes for decades, and that no official government action has been taken to convert it into a public utility zone.

Possession and Legal Precedents: According to legal precedents in Goa, long-term possession of land (especially for over 12 years) can establish ownership, especially in the absence of government action to dispute the title. The Limitation Act of 1963 allows individuals to claim title to land through adverse possession if the possession is continuous, exclusive, and without dispute for a period of 12 years.

Court’s Conclusion:
The court finds in favor of the plaintiff, Raju, for the following reasons:

The State of Goa has failed to provide adequate documentation to prove its claim over the disputed land or its intent to acquire the land for public purposes.

Raju has demonstrated continuous and uninterrupted possession of the land for over 12 years, supported by the payment of land taxes and credible testimonies.

The land in question does not fall within any recognized public infrastructure development zone, and thus the State of Goa's claim of public ownership is not substantiated by available evidence.

Sentencing/Relief:
Property Ownership Confirmation: The State of Goa is directed to recognize the ownership of Raju over the disputed land. The plaintiff is entitled to register the land in his name in the official land records.

Restoration of Possession: The State is directed to stop any encroachments or actions that hinder the plaintiff’s possession of the land.

Compensation for Legal Costs: The State of Goa is directed to pay Rs. 2,00,000 to the plaintiff for legal expenses and emotional distress caused by the prolonged dispute.

Return of Possession: Any government agencies or entities that have unlawfully taken possession of the land are ordered to vacate the property immediately.
